About libtrax
=============

What is TraX protocol?
----------------------

Tracking eXchange protocol is a simple protocol that enables easier evaluation
of computer vision tracking algorithms. The basic idea is that a tracker 
communicates with the evaluation software using a set of textual commands
over the standard input/output streams.

Reference implementation
------------------------

libtrax is a reference C implementation for the Tracking eXchange protocol that
enables researchers to quickly enable support for the protocol in their C or
C++ tracker. An example is provided for the OpenCV implementation of the CamShift
tracker that shows how to approach the integration.
